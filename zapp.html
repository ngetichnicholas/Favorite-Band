           <h2>Zapp & Roger</h2>
           <P>Zapp (also known as the <em>Zapp Band,</em>  Zapp & Roger) is an American funk band that emerged from Dayton, Ohio, United States, in 1977. 
             Particularly influential in the electro subgenre of funk, Zapp were known for their trademark use of the talk-box effect. The
              original line-up consisted of four Troutman brothers—frontman Roger, Larry, Lester and Terry—and non-Troutman family members
               Bobby Glover, Gregory Jackson, Sherman Fleetwood, Jerome Derrickson, Eddie Barber and Jannetta Boyce. Zapp also worked closely 
               with George Clinton and Bootsy Collins of Parliament-Funkadelic during its early stages, their support being a factor in the group
                gaining a record deal with Warner Bros. </P>
         
                <p>Zapp & Roger became my favorite band mainly because of their slow moving relaxing music . Their music normally gives me company while doing 
                  anything even while resting</p> My best among their songs is <em>I wanna Be Your Man</em>

                <h4>Roger Troutman</h4>
                <p>Roger Troutman (November 29, 1951 – April 25, 1999), also known mononymously as Roger, was an American singer, 
                  composer, songwriter, producer, multi-instrumentalist and the founder of the band Zapp who helped spearhead the 
                  funk movement and heavily influenced West Coast hip hop due to the scene's heavy sampling of his music over the years. 
                  Troutman was well known for his use of the talk box, a device that is connected to an instrument (frequently a keyboard, 
                  but most commonly a guitar) to create different vocal effects. Roger used a custom-made talkbox—the Electro Harmonix
                   "Golden Throat"—through a Moog Minimoog and later in his career a Yamaha DX100 FM synthesizer. As both band leader
                    of Zapp and in his subsequent solo releases, he scored a bevy of funk and R&B hits throughout the 1980s 
                  and regularly collaborated with hip hop artists in the 1990s.</p>
                  <p>
                   In 1981, Troutman cut The Many Facets of Roger, his first solo album. Featuring a funk cover of Marvin Gaye's <em>I Heard 
                     It Through the Grapevine</em> , which went to number 1 on the R&B singles chart, the album sold over a million copies. The album also 
                   featured the hit <em>So Ruff, So Tuff"</em> , which was similar 
                   to <em>More Bounce...</em>as were most Roger/Zapp singles during this time. The same year, Troutman recorded with Parliament-Funkadelic 
                   on the band's final Warner Brothers' album The Electric Spanking of War Babies.</p>
             <p>
               In 1984, Troutman issued his second solo album <em>The Saga Continues...,</em>  which featured the singles <em>Girl Cut It Out",It's in the 
                 Mix </em> (which was dedicated to Soul Train and its host Don Cornelius), and a cover of Wilson Pickett's <em>In the Midnight Hour</em> , which
                featured gospel group the Mighty Clouds of Joy. In 1987, Troutman scored his most successful solo album with Unlimited!, carried by
                 the massive hit <em>I Want to Be Your Man"</em>  which rose to number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the R&B chart.
             </p>
                   <p>
                     Alongside his successful career as Zapp member and solo artist, Troutman also became a producer and writer for other artists including 
                     Shirley Murdock, whose 1985 Platinum debut featured the Roger-produced hit <em>As We Lay</em> . He also produced for Zapp member Dale DeGroat 
                     on his solo efforts. In 1988, Troutman made an appearance on Scritti Politti's third album Provision, providing talk box vocals on the
                      songs <em>Boom There She Was</em>. </p>
