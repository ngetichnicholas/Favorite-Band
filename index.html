 <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
 <P>Zapp (also known as the Zapp Band, Zapp & Roger) is an American funk band that emerged from Dayton, Ohio, United States, in 1977. 
   Particularly influential in the electro subgenre of funk, Zapp were known for their trademark use of the talk-box effect. The
    original line-up consisted of four Troutman brothers—frontman Roger, Larry, Lester and Terry—and non-Troutman family members
     Bobby Glover, Gregory Jackson, Sherman Fleetwood, Jerome Derrickson, Eddie Barber and Jannetta Boyce. Zapp also worked closely 
     with George Clinton and Bootsy Collins of Parliament-Funkadelic during its early stages, their support being a factor in the group
      gaining a record deal with Warner Bros. </P>

   <h4>Roger Troutman</h4>
   <p>Roger Troutman (November 29, 1951 – April 25, 1999), also known mononymously as Roger, was an American singer, 
     composer, songwriter, producer, multi-instrumentalist and the founder of the band Zapp who helped spearhead the 
     funk movement and heavily influenced West Coast hip hop due to the scene's heavy sampling of his music over the years. 
     Troutman was well known for his use of the talk box, a device that is connected to an instrument (frequently a keyboard, 
     but most commonly a guitar) to create different vocal effects. Roger used a custom-made talkbox—the Electro Harmonix
      "Golden Throat"—through a Moog Minimoog and later in his career a Yamaha DX100 FM synthesizer. As both band leader
       of Zapp and in his subsequent solo releases, he scored a bevy of funk and R&B hits throughout the 1980s 
     and regularly collaborated with hip hop artists in the 1990s.</p>
     <p>
      In 1981, Troutman cut The Many Facets of Roger, his first solo album. Featuring a funk cover of Marvin Gaye's "I Heard 
      It Through the Grapevine", which went to number 1 on the R&B singles chart, the album sold over a million copies. The album also 
      featured the hit "So Ruff, So Tuff", which was similar 
      to "More Bounce..." as were most Roger/Zapp singles during this time. The same year, Troutman recorded with Parliament-Funkadelic 
      on the band's final Warner Brothers' album The Electric Spanking of War Babies.</p>
<p>
  In 1984, Troutman issued his second solo album The Saga Continues..., which featured the singles "Girl Cut It Out", "It's in the 
  Mix" (which was dedicated to Soul Train and its host Don Cornelius), and a cover of Wilson Pickett's "In the Midnight Hour", which
   featured gospel group the Mighty Clouds of Joy. In 1987, Troutman scored his most successful solo album with Unlimited!, carried by
    the massive hit "I Want to Be Your Man" which rose to number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the R&B chart.
</p>
      <p>
        Alongside his successful career as Zapp member and solo artist, Troutman also became a producer and writer for other artists including 
        Shirley Murdock, whose 1985 Platinum debut featured the Roger-produced hit "As We Lay". He also produced for Zapp member Dale DeGroat 
        on his solo efforts. In 1988, Troutman made an appearance on Scritti Politti's third album Provision, providing talk box vocals on the
         songs "Boom There She Was" and "Sugar and Spice". </p>
         <p>
        Three years later, Troutman released his final solo album with Bridging the Gap, featuring the hit "Everybody (Get Up)". He worked with 
        Elvis Costello on the song "The Other Side of Summer". In 1989, NBA Entertainment selected Troutman among a variety of candidates to 
        record a tribute song called "I'm So Happy" for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

      Away" and "Paint My Love".   </p>
      <p>
        Richter was born on 24 June 1963 in New Hampshire, United States, before his family decided to move back to Denmark, 
        where they settled in Århus. He holds both Danish and American citizenship. As a child, Richter started playing the 
        flute and cello and then the piano. He was raised with classical music, however, in his early teenage years he started
