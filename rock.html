           <h2>Michael Learns To Rock</h2>
           <P>Michael Learns to Rock (also known as MLTR) is a Danish soft rock band formed in 1988. The band currently consists of Jascha Richter, 
             Mikkel Lentz and Kåre Wanscher. Søren Madsen was an original member of the group since its formation but left in 2000. The band has
              sold over 11 million records over the course of their career, with the majority sold in Europe and Asia. Despite being Danish, 
              the band performs songs in English. The band has attributed its success in Asia to their drugs-free, clean-living image and to singing 
             in English as a second language.</P>
             <p>I first came to learnt about MLTR when I listened to their song <em>Sleeping Child</em>so long ago. Later I searched more of their music 
               and I found more interesting and enjoyable. My best among these song is <em>Someday.</em> </p>

                <h4>Jascha Richter</h4>
                <p>
                  Jascha Richter (born 24 June 1963) is a Danish-American singer-songwriter best known as the lead vocalist and keyboardist of the 
                  soft rock band Michael Learns to Rock, where he composes and sings most of their songs. Some of his best known songs include 
                  <em>25 Minutes, The Actor,Sleeping Child,That's Why (You Go Away), Take Me to Your Heart, Someday, Out of the Blue,You Took My Heart Away</em> and <em> Paint My Love. </em>   </p>
                  <p>
                    Richter was born on 24 June 1963 in New Hampshire, United States, before his family decided to move back to Denmark, 
                    where they settled in Århus. He holds both Danish and American citizenship. As a child, Richter started playing the 
                    flute and cello and then the piano. He was raised with classical music, however, in his early teenage years he started 
                    to play and compose pop music. Growing up, he listened to Elton John, Supertramp and Bee Gees among others. Richter is 
                    known as the brain behind the Danish pop rock band Michael Learns to Rock.
            
                   Richter has also released two solo albums, <em>Planet Blue</em>  in 2002 and <em>Where I Belong</em>  in 2006.
